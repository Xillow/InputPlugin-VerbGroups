# Importing The Library

!> Input is intended for use with Git, or an equivalent source control system. You should set up source control before importing Input.

You can find the latest version of Input in [the repository releases](https://github.com/offalynne/Input/releases). Make sure that you're using a version of GameMaker that Input supports, and then download the `.yymps` from that page and import into your GameMaker project. You'll see a folder called `Input` appear in your asset browser, and a few external data files will also be created in your Included Files.

If you look inside the Input folder you'll see a lot of subfolders. These subfolders contain functions that comprise the API - the interface that you'll need to execute Input code in your game. The `(System)` folder holds code that Input requires to operate and has to be there but otherwise you can forget it exists. You'll also see a folder called `Configuration` - inside this folder are a series of scripts that control how Input functions. **You should edit these scripts to tailor Input to your needs.**

### Updating Input

From time to time weâ€™ll need to release updates to Input, either to add new features or to address bugs.

1. Create a backup of your configuration scripts, preferably via source control
2. Delete the Input folder from the asset browser
3. Import the Input .yymps from the GitHub releases page
4. Restore your configuration scripts. Some macros may have changed between versions so take special care when restoring values
