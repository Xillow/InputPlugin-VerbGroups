<h1>Verb Groups Input Plug-in</h1>

Verb Groups Functionality for [Input for GameMaker 2024.8](https://github.com/offalynne/Input) 

Allows you to differentiate groups of verbs that should not affect one another when checking for collisions. This is useful for separating sets of verbs that are contextually separate, such as verbs that are used in a menu and verbs that are used during gameplay. By putting menu verbs and gameplay verbs in two different groups, two identical bindings in two different groups can co-exist. A verb can only be in one group at a time and, once assigned a group, will only collide with other verbs in that group. If a verb is not assigned to a group then it may collide with all verbs, regardless of what group the colliding verb is in.
